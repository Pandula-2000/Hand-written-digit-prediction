# Hand-written-digit-prediction
My first ML program to predict handwritten digits using python and tensorflow.

### How to Run
-Copy the content in the hand_written_digits folder.
-The png images are the test files for the code.
-Just run the python file.

### Additional comments
-The accuracy of the model was not that good for the given png images. This can be due to the fact that they are not handwritten. If we use handwritten and scanned images the accuracy might be much better.
